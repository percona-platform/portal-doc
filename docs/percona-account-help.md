# Registration and Log in
You can log into Percona Platform either with a Percona Account or via an external identity provider.

## Log in with a Percona account
A Percona Account is your all-access pass to various Percona services, including Percona Platform, Percona Customer Portal and Community Forum.

With a Percona Account, you can sign in to any Percona service using the same email address and password. This means that you don’t need to manage separate login accounts for each service:

## Social log in via Google or GitHub
As an alternative to connecting with a Percona Account username and password, you can now also sign in and register with your Google or GitHub account. 
For GitHub, make sure that your email address is set to public so that Percona Platform can use it during authentication.

## Log in via custom identity provider
To configure and enable custom identity provider for your account, contact [Percona Support](https://www.percona.com/about-percona/contact).

## Sign up for a Percona Account
1. Go to the [Percona Log in page](hhttps://portal.percona.com/) page.
2. Enter your work or professional email address and specify a valid password.
3. Enter your first and last name, then click **Create** once you’ve accepted the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. 
4. Check your email for a verification message and follow the instructions to activate your account. 
 
## Manage your Percona Account 
Because your Percona Account is used across all your Percona services, it’s important to keep your account safe and your information up-to-date. 

To manage your account:

1. Sign in to your Percona Account and click your user icon on the right hand-side of the screen.
2. Choose **Profile > Edit Profile**. This displays the **Account** page where you can update your account information and set up two-factor authentication (2FA). 

### Set up two-factor authentication###
Two-factor authentication significantly increases the security of your Percona Account. 

After enabling 2FA, signing into your account will require both your password and access to a trusted device via one or more of the following authenticators:

* [Okta Verify for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okta.android.auth) or [Okta Verify for iOS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okta.android.auth) 
* [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
* Security key or a biometric authenticator like Windows Hello, Touch ID, etc.

To turn on or manage two-factor authentication:

1. On your **Account** page, scroll down to the **Extra Verification** section. 
2. Click **Set up** next to the security method you want to configure, and follow the on-screen instructions.

To disable an authenticator app, simply click **Remove** next to its name in the **Extra Verification** section.

### Change your password

To change your current password for your Percona Account:

1. Go to your **Account** page **> Change Password** section.
2. Enter your current password, then specify and confirm your new password.
3. Click **Change Password**.

### Update profile information

To update your account information, click **Edit** in the **Personal Information** section. Here you can change your display name, add a secondary email address or your phone number. 

If you need to change the display language for your account, click **Edit** in the **Display Language** section. Note that email notifications are currently always delivered in English.
