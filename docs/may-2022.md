## Enhancements

### Ability to remove servers from the list of connected PMM instances
Users with PMM Admin rights can now remove entries from the list of servers connected to Percona Platform. This is useful for getting rid of lingering servers that Percona Platform can no longer reach because they lost internet connection. 

To remove a disconnected server and keep an accurate list of your PMM servers, go to the **PMM Instances** tab on the main menu, and click the ![Remove icon](images/remove-instance.png) next to the server you want to remove from the list.

## Fixed issue
Removed vertical scroll bar that appeared on the Log in page after entering an email address in the **Sign in to Percona Platform** box.
